Lattice gauge theories serve as a powerful model for understanding the *continuous* gauge field theories which underpin our universe. Yet beyond their foundational significance, they are also a rich source of novel physics in their own right, and are realisable on todayâ€™s quantum simulators. Recent attention has been drawn to their potential to exhibit robust localization phenomena despite the absence of disorder and the presence of long-ranged interactions, which typically preclude localisation.<!--more-->

We show that in the strong-confinement regime, the Hilbert space becomes fractured into *exponentially many subspaces* which are only weakly connected, leading to an unusual sublogarithmic entanglement growth.

*PS: we later concluded that this "unusual" growth was not in fact sublogarithmic, but
simply logarithmic with a very slow, power-law, approach to saturation. See [our later published work](/publication/2025-04-18-HSF-origin-DFL-lattice-Schwinger-model).*
