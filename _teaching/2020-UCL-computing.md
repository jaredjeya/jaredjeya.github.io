At UCL, I assisted with teaching two different undergraduate computing courses: an introduction to programming course for first-year students, and a more advanced course on scientific computing for second-year students.

For both, I assisted with the running of workshops, where students would work through exercises on their
own and ask for help from demonstrators.<!--more-->

PHAS0007: Practical Physics & Computing
======

This was a first-year course introducing students to the basics of programming, using Python, and
the basics of libraries such as `numpy` and `matplotlib`. Each week, students would have an extended
problem to complete at home, which usually connected to physics in some way.
These would then be marked by demonstrators one-on-one during the workshops, allowing students to get
direct feedback on their work.

I taught this course twice: once in 2020-21 (which was online), and again the next year in 2021-22.

PHAS0030: Computational Physics
======

This second-year course covered a number of advanced numerical methods, as well as refreshing students
on the basics of `numpy`. For example, students learnt how to solve differential equations (both ordinary and partial), such as the evolution of a quantum wavepacket through a 2D potential landscape.

I taught this course three times: the first time was in Term 2 of 2020-21, with the unexpected roadbloack that the university shut down in March due to the pandemic and we had to scramble to find an online solution! I taught it again in 2021-22, and then again in 2022-23 (which was back to in-person).
