Lattice gauge theories, the discrete counterparts of continuum gauge theories, provide a rich framework for studying non-equilibrium quantum dynamics. Recent studies suggest disorder-free localization in the lattice Schwinger model, but its origin remains unclear. Using a combination of analytical and numerical methods, we show that Hilbert space fragmentation emerges in the strong coupling limit, constraining particle dynamics and causing sharp jumps in entanglement entropy growth within charge sectors.<!--more-->

By analyzing jump statistics, we find that entanglement growth follows a single-logarithmic or weak power-law dependence on time, rather than a double-logarithmic form. This suggests a single ergodicity-breaking regime that mimics many-body localization in finite systems due to fragmentation effects.

Our findings clarify the nature of disorder-free localization and its distinction from conventional many-body localization, highlighting how gauge constraints influence thermalization in lattice gauge theories.
