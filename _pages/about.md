**Website construction in progress!**

I am interested in non-equilibrium quantum many-body physics - in particular, ergodicity breaking (where matter taken out of equilibrium fails to thermalise), such as when strong quenched disorder is applied to an interacting system to localise it.
I have also recently been studying fragmentation in lattice gauge theories and tensor network methods.
At Nottingham, where I work jointly with [Adam Gammon-Smith](https://adamsmith-physics.github.io/index.html), [Juan P. Garrahan](https://jpgarrahan.github.io/About.html), [Bruno Bertini](https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/staff/profiles/physics/bertini-bruno), and [Igor Lesanovsky](https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/physics/people/igor.lesanovsky), I will be taking these themes and combining them with a quantum circuit perspective.
