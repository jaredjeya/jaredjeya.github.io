## Privacy Policy

The privacy of my visitors is extremely important. This Privacy Policy outlines the types of personal information that is received and collected and how it is used.

First and foremost, I will never share your email address or any other personal information to anyone without your direct consent.

### Log Files

Like many other websites, this site uses log files to help learn about when, from where, and how often traffic flows to this site. These log files are necessary for the functioning of this website.

The information in these log files include:

* Internet Protocol addresses (IP)

* Internet Service Provider (ISP)
* Date and time stamp
* Referring and exit pages
* Number of clicks

All of this information is not linked to anything that is personally identifiable.

### Cookies and Web Beacons

I use cookies to store information about visitors' preferences and to record user-specific information on which pages the site visitor accesses or visits. You can choose to disable or selectively turn off cookies in your browser settings. However, this can affect how you are able to interact with this site as well as other websites.

<!-- When you visit this site "convenience" cookies are stored on your computer when you submit a comment to help you log in faster to [Disqus](http://disqus.com) the next time you leave a comment. -->

### Google Analytics

Google Analytics is a web analytics tool I use to help understand how visitors engage with this website. It reports website trends using cookies and web beacons without identifying individual visitors. You can read [Google Analytics Privacy Policy](http://www.google.com/analytics/learn/privacy.html).

Google Analytics will be disabled unless and until you accept the "analytics" purpose when you first visit this site, or otherwise by clicking the cookie button in the bottom right corner of the page.
